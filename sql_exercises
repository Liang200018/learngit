create activity_monthly_number
(
int(5)
)
select count(*) as number_nine
from et_activity
where date(enroll_start_time) between '2019-09-01' and '2019-09-30';

select count(*) as number_ten
from et_activity
where date(enroll_start_time) between '2019-10-01' and '2019-10-31';

select count(*) as number_eleven
from et_activity
where date(enroll_start_time) between '2019-11-01' and '2019-11-30';

	
	

//按周计算活动数目，从周一开始算每周的第一天
select date(enroll_start_time),week(enroll_start_time,1),count(week(enroll_start_time,1))
from et_activity
where date(enroll_start_time) between '2019-09-01' and '2019-11-30'
group by week(enroll_start_time,1);

select id,scan_num
from et_activity
order by scan_num desc;

select id,scan_num
from et_activity

select id,max_enroll_number,current_enroll_number
from et_activity
where max_enroll_number >=0
and
date(enroll_start_time) between '2019-09-01' and '2019-11-30';

select username,creator_id,department_name,count(creator_id)
